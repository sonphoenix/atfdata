## 🌌 Overview

**ATF Data** is a creative freelance portfolio that doubles as an immersive experience. Rather than a standard portfolio, the site is built like a **video game** — visitors navigate a space-themed galaxy, explore projects like RPG entries, and discover real-time stats pulled live from GitHub.

The site showcases two service paths:

- **`</>` Full-Stack Development** — production-ready web applications and SaaS platforms
- **`📊` Data Analysis** — advanced analytics, data engineering, and actionable insights

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎮 Gamified Project Explorer
The Projects section is navigated like a 3D space map. Users move through a galaxy using **WASD / arrow keys** (or a gamepad) and dock onto project planets. Each project is presented as an **RPG-style card** with:
- A level rating (e.g., `LV.87`)
- A **radar chart** scoring the project across 5 dimensions: Frontend, Backend, Features, Database, and DevOps
- A scrollable image gallery
- A live tech stack breakdown

### 🔗 Live GitHub Integration
When entering a project, the site fetches **live data directly from the GitHub API** — displaying real commit history, repo stats, and metadata dynamically, not hardcoded text.

### 🪐 Two Project Paths
Projects are organized by specialty:
- **Software Engineer Path** — full-stack apps, SaaS tools, APIs
- **Data Analyst Path** — data pipelines, dashboards, analytical work

### 🌐 Multi-Language Support
Built-in language switcher for internationalization.
